# Vocab Express/Crud with Authorization
A Node/Express website that provides logged in users with access to a vocab database with words and definitions. Users have the ability to down vote a word as well as save it to their own personal list that can be generated randomly in their profile.

## How It's Made:

ES6, EJS, Node and in particular using the express and passport modules. CRUD principles utilized.

## Optimizations
There's a few more things I could do with this. I would like to remove some of the functionality that I put on to the profile page and add it to the main page that's seen after login. I also want users to be able to suggest specific edits to specific words, and also for users that go to submit a new word to have the current database scanned to ensure a copy of that word doesn't already exist.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great practice in using EJS and Node with express and passport as well as gaining greater organziation over my web pages and routes.
